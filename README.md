# TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

More details in Udacity's [github repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/project-tv-script-generation/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)!

The generated script... could you use some more hyperparam tuning, but did achieve the goal of > 3.5 loss.
